[Apple iOS 14: Action Steps Needed Now:-]{.s1}

[1. Implement the Conversion API via Partner Integration (Big Platforms
like Shopify, Woocommerce etc.) or manually (recommended) with Developer
Tools

[- This helps you track based on information completed on your site
through other means than cache-based pixel events.]{.s1}

[2. [[Verify your
domain]{.s4}](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/286768115176155)]{.s6}

[- This ensures you're set up as "official" to Facebook.]{.s1}

[3. Decide which eight events for conversions you'll track.
Then [[customize them in the Events
Manager]{.s4}](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/422408905612648/)]{.s1}

[- Reporting will be very different. Facebook states, "The 8 conversion
events per domain will be ranked based on priority. If multiple events
are completed by a user (i.e. "add to cart" and "purchase") only the
higher prioritized event will be reported."]{.s1}

[4. Calculate your delayed attribution multipliers (How long your funnel
is and how many touchpoints you need)]{.s1}

[- This helps you understand which percentage of your conversions come
after 7 days and 28 days. and when your final touchpoint should
be.)]{.s1}

[5. Prepare for reporting within Facebook to be less-complete]{.s1}

[- Facebook states, "Certain attribution windows will have partial
reporting and metrics will not include many of the events from iOS 14
users. \[It'll be communicated\] when a metric is partial."]{.s1}

[6. Install a post-purchase attribution survey tool, like Prove It
Post-Purchase Surveys]{.s1}

[- You will absolutely need this to understand the true impact
of Facebook and Instagram's ads on your sales funnel.]{.s1}

[- Other important questions include \"What made you decide to buy this
product\" or \"What else would you like to see from us)]{.s1}
